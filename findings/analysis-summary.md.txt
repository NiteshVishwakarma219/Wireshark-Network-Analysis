## Key Findings

- ICMP packets confirmed active host connectivity
- DNS traffic showed successful domain resolution
- HTTP traffic exposed unencrypted data
- SYN scan behavior indicated reconnaissance attempt

## Security Impact
- Unencrypted protocols pose credential theft risk
- Port scanning can lead to further exploitation

## Recommendations
- Use HTTPS instead of HTTP
- Implement IDS/IPS
- Monitor SYN flood patterns
