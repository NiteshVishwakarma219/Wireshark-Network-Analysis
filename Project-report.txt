📊 Network Traffic Analysis & Threat Detection Using Wireshark
1. Introduction

Network traffic analysis is a critical task for Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts to detect malicious activities, troubleshoot network issues, and identify security risks.
This project focuses on analyzing live network traffic using Wireshark to understand normal and suspicious behavior across common protocols.

The objective is to simulate real-world SOC scenarios such as:

ICMP reconnaissance

DNS monitoring

HTTP traffic analysis

Credential sniffing

Port scan detection

2. Objective of the Project

Capture and analyze live network traffic

Understand how different protocols behave

Identify potential security threats

Practice SOC-level packet analysis

Gain hands-on experience with Wireshark filters

3. Tools & Environment
Component	Description
Tool	Wireshark
OS	Windows / Kali Linux (VMware)
Network	Wi-Fi
Capture Type	Live packet capture
Analysis Type	Manual packet inspection
4. Network Architecture (Logical)
User System
   |
Wi-Fi Router
   |
Internet


Traffic is captured from the Wi-Fi interface and analyzed locally using Wireshark.

5. Methodology

Start live capture on Wi-Fi interface

Generate traffic (ping, browsing, DNS queries)

Apply Wireshark display filters

Analyze packet details

Identify normal vs suspicious behavior

Document findings with screenshots

6. Analysis & Findings
6.1 ICMP Analysis (Ping Traffic)

Filter Used:

icmp


Observation:

ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply packets observed

Indicates successful connectivity testing

Security Relevance:

Excessive ICMP traffic may indicate reconnaissance or network mapping

Conclusion:
✔ Normal ICMP activity observed

6.2 DNS Traffic Analysis

Filter Used:

dns


Observation:

DNS queries and responses captured

Domain name resolution visible

Security Relevance:

Suspicious domains may indicate malware or C2 communication

DNS tunneling can bypass firewalls

Conclusion:
✔ Legitimate DNS resolution observed

6.3 HTTP Traffic Analysis

Filter Used:

http


Observation:

HTTP GET and response packets captured

Unencrypted web traffic visible

Security Relevance:

HTTP traffic can expose sensitive data

Lack of encryption is a security risk

Conclusion:
⚠ Insecure HTTP communication detected

6.4 Credential Sniffing (HTTP POST)

Filter Used:

http.request.method == "POST"


Observation:

HTTP POST requests identified

Username and password visible in plaintext (when applicable)

Security Risk:

Credentials transmitted without encryption

Vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks

Conclusion:
❌ Critical security risk identified

6.5 Port Scan / Reconnaissance Detection

Filter Used:

tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0


Observation:

Multiple SYN packets sent to different ports

No ACK response from destination

Security Relevance:

Typical behavior of SYN scan

Indicates reconnaissance activity

Conclusion:
⚠ Potential port scanning detected

7. Key Learnings

Understanding of TCP/IP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP protocols

Ability to detect insecure communication

Hands-on experience in packet inspection

Practical SOC analyst skills

Importance of encrypted traffic (HTTPS)

8. Limitations

HTTPS payload not readable due to encryption

No IDS/IPS integration

Analysis limited to local network traffic

9. Future Scope

Integrate with SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK)

Analyze PCAP files from malware traffic

Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK

Automate alerts using IDS tools (Snort/Suricata)

10. Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical network traffic analysis using Wireshark and highlights common security threats such as credential exposure and port scanning.
The hands-on approach strengthens SOC analyst skills and provides real-world exposure to packet-level security monitoring.
